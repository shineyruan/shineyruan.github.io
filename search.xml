<h1 id="background-the-impact-of-covid-19"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#background-the-impact-of-covid-19"></a> Background: The Impact of COVID-19</h1>
<p>The outbreak of novel coronavirus COVID-19 in 2020 has brought huge attention to the administration of human society. “Social distancing” has been advocated as a very effective method to fight the virus. In order to facilitate the implementation of social distancing, we propose an idea of building a portable device that is capable of <em>detect and predict flow statistics in real time</em>, in order to provide insights and suggestions for traffic management.</p>
<p>With the development of computer vision technology, nowadays it has become much easier and cheaper to put cameras into all parts of industry to perform a variety of detection tasks. In order to make our product cost-efficient, we also decided to take the advantage of computer vision and developed a <em>vision-based</em> solution for real-time flow detection. To ensure that our product is portable to use, we also settled down the plan that our whole system should be running on a Raspberry Pi.</p>
<h1 id="concept-generation"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#concept-generation"></a> Concept Generation</h1>
<p align="center"></p>
    <img src="/images/450_MorphologicalAnalysis.png" alt="Morphological chart." width="500">
<p>What constitutes to our product? First, in order to satisfy the basic requirements, our final product must be capable of detecting human traffic flow (i.e. pedestrians) through cameras. Therefore, there must be some part transforming the live video stream into detection results. As a result, we name this part an <strong>object detector.</strong> Second, we need to make sure that our system is capable of assigning “identities” to objects in the camera frame so that it could detect which person leaves the frame and which person enters the frame and we call this part an <strong>object tracker.</strong> Third, we wish to store a fixed amount of history data so that we could utilize it to predict future flow statistics changes. This means that we also need a <strong>back-end server.</strong> Last but not least, we’ll have to display our flow analysis results somewhere. We decided to host them on a self-designed <strong>front-end website.</strong></p>
<p>From the above morphological analysis, we settled down the final configuration of our product: an object detector, an object tracker, a back-end server, and a front-end website.</p>
<h1 id="key-technologies"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#key-technologies"></a> Key Technologies</h1>
<p>After we settled down the big picture of our project, we then proceeded to conduct tests and develop the final product. After several months of discussions and developments, our final product have utilized the following technologies.</p>
<h2 id="object-detector-mobilenet-ssd"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#object-detector-mobilenet-ssd"></a> Object Detector: MobileNet-SSD</h2>
<p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the first solution we have thought of for object detection. It has multiple advantages over other techniques such as traditional computer vision methods, including better robustness and lower implementational cost.</p>
<p>However, not all DNNs are suitable for our project. In fact, most of the state-of-the-art DNN detectors require a lot of computing resources such as high-performance deep learning graphics cards and are generally run on big enterprise servers. Therefore, we have to select the DNN with a relatively high performance and the least required computing resources.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381">MobileNet v2</a>-based <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-46448-0_2">Single Shot MultiBox Detector</a> (MobileNet-SSD) becomes our final solution, because it is accurate, lightweight, and was specifically designed for mobile devices.</p>
<h2 id="object-tracker-kalman-filter"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#object-tracker-kalman-filter"></a> Object Tracker: Kalman Filter</h2>
<p>Kalman filter is a probabilistic model that has been widely used in control theories and applications. Particularly, it has its own <em>states</em> that are hidden from the outer world and only certain state properties can be <em>observed</em> by outer worlds through sensors. The main task of the model is to use a certain amount of observations to predict the next states of the model. Hence, we can utilize this property of Kalman filter and construct one Kalman filter for each object that we’re going to track. Once the Kalman filter is constructed, we can utilize the prediction of its position in the next frame and cross-check with the detection results of the next frame to determine whether this object is “disappeared.”</p>

    <title>SLAM — Simultaneous Localization And Mapping</title>
    <url>/2020/01/13/467slam/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Simultaneous Localization And Mapping, also known as SLAM, is a set of very important techniques in robotics, and it’s still in active research. It aims at developing different algorithms for figuring out the position of the robot in the real world by the robot itself.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h1 id="background-what-is-slam"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#background-what-is-slam"></a> Background: What is SLAM?</h1>
<p>Think about a scenario where you were led to an unknown building, and you were standing at the beginning of a corridor. Yes, right now you were completely lost, and you wanted to figure out your position in the building. With initially zero information, you now began to look around at the surroundings. Very soon, you acquired a general sense of where you are with respect to all the objects around you. Then you realized that keeping standing at the same place won’t offer you more information, and you began to move. While you were moving, you kept checking out the new surroundings, obtained information about your new position, and updated your prior positions with the new information. Finally, you reached the end of the corridor, with a complete local map of the general shape of the corridor in your head. If you kept going, you would obtain more and more information about the new environment and also get your prior information updated. At some point you would be familiar enough with the building to figure out where you were in it.</p>
<p>Although it might seem natural for readers as you to get familiar with an unknown environment by looking and walking around, this process is actually complicated when it comes to applying it on a robot. In the field of robotics, this process is called <strong>SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping)</strong>. So far, there have been a number of different models that accomplish this task, with one of the most basic model called <em>Markov Localization</em>.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2019, I took the course <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~kuipers/teaching/eecs467-F19.html"><em>Autonomous Robotics (EECS 467)</em></a>, in which I implemented a complete SLAM algorithm with occupancy grid mapping and Markov Localization for a robot car with 3 other teammates <a href="https://github.com/Gregory-Meyer">Gregory Meyer</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nlbrown2">Nathan Brown</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/martindeegan">Martin Deegan</a>.</p>

    <title>Minecraft Game Programming</title>
    <url>/2020/12/09/560proj/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In the fall of 2020, I finally had a chance to explore the field of computer graphics at University of Pennsylvania, and did a very interesting course project which builds a simplified Minecraft from scratch. This game is built on OpenGL 3.2 with Qt 5.15.0. Through building this game, I learned a lot about OpenGL rendering pipeline, game engine &amp; texture mapping.</p>

<h1 id="overview"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#overview"></a> Overview</h1>
<p>Minecraft is originally well-known for its block-like structure. Everything is made of blocks, including mountains, trees, grasses, people, cows, zombies, etc. Although it might seem a little bit weird, this actually creates a really amazing, retro vibe as if you were playing those good old, low-resolution video games in the 70s and 80s. What’s more, I personally think that using different types of blocks to create a huge variety of objects from scratch is one of the essence of Minecraft. It is exactly because of the set-up of blocks that players can easily make things on their own.</p>
<p><img src="/images/minecraft.png" alt="Minecraft (Java edition) main menu."></p>
<h2 id="blocks"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#blocks"></a> Blocks</h2>
<p>Minecraft is a game only built upon <code>Block</code>s. Each block is defined to be a 1x1 cube in 3D space. All <code>Block</code>s can only be arranged adjacent to each other without any translation or rotation. Now you may wonder: aren’t there items such as leaves, torches, ladders, sticks in Minecraft that don’t look like a cube? Well, yes, but these are considered to be <em>specially-shaped blocks</em>. There are still many <em>regular-shaped blocks</em> such as stones, dirt, ice that look exactly like a 3D cube. Those specially-shaped blocks are <strong>only treated in their special shapes when rendering game graphics,</strong> but when it comes to the deep low-level gaming logic, such as finding the state of the block (occupied/unoccupied) or the center position of the block, etc., these specially-shaped blocks are treated just like the regular ones!</p>
<p>Minecraft has lots of different types of blocks. Passionate Minecraft gamers also keeps adding new types of blocks to the original game to make it more playable. For my own Minecraft game, I have currently only created the following types of blocks:</p>
<p>Regular blocks (3D cubic shape):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CLOUD</code></li>
<li><code>GRASS</code></li>
<li><code>DIRT</code></li>
<li><code>STONE</code></li>
<li><code>SNOW</code> (actually corresponds to snow blocks in original Minecraft)</li>
<li><code>ICE</code></li>
<li><code>REDSTONE_LAMP</code></li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>Specially-shaped blocks:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>REDSTONE_TORCH</code></li>
<li><code>LEVER</code></li>
<li><code>REDSTONE_WIRE</code></li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>In additional to the regular biomes such as grasslands, mountains, forests in original Minecraft, we also created a new biome called <em>Heaven</em>. Heaven consists of <code>CLOUD</code> as the ground, and we used <code>QUARTZ</code>, <code>GOLD</code> and <code>QUARTZ_BRICK</code> to build a very large temple for God in Heaven. For details, please see our demo video!</p>
<h2 id="chunks"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#chunks"></a> Chunks</h2>
<p>Minecraft has a very huge map. It is impossible for the game to load all the maps into PC memory every time on start-up. Hence, it is critical for Minecraft to come up with a plan to only load the surrounding map at the player’s location. In fact, Minecraft actually divides the entire map into <code>Chunks</code>, where each <code>Chunk</code> consists of 16x256x16 blocks (<em>x, y, z</em> direction, respectively; <em>y</em> is the direction pointing “upwards” <em>i.e.,</em> to the sky). Upon rendering, each <code>Chunk</code> would be the <strong>smallest unit for rendering.</strong> This mean that Minecraft doesn’t render the surface of all blocks one by one. Instead, only rendering the surface (the boundary between an opaque block (<code>STONE</code>, <code>DIRT</code>, <code>SNOW</code>, etc.) and a transparent block (<code>EMPTY</code>, <code>WATER</code>, <code>ICE</code>, etc.)) of an entire <code>Chunk</code> would be much more efficient and make the game more responsive.</p>
<h2 id="terrains-terrain-generation-zones"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#terrains-terrain-generation-zones"></a> Terrains, Terrain Generation Zones</h2>
<p>When it comes to map loading, it is easy to discover that only loading one chunk (16x16 blocks in <em>x, z</em> direction) at a time reveals way too little information of the player’s surroundings. A simple solution is that we can group <code>Chunk</code>s together and form <code>Terrain</code>s. As a result, each <code>Terrain</code> is defined to have 4x4 <code>Chunk</code>s in the <em>x</em>, <em>z</em> direction (64x64 blocks; 64x256x64 blocks for <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>z</em>). Furthermore, 5x5 <code>Terrain</code>s form a <em>terrain generation zone.</em> In this way, we can now always <strong>keep loading the terrain generation zone centered at the chunk where player is standing,</strong> which means we load 20x20 <code>Chunks</code> surrounding the player. Once the player moves off a <code>Chunk</code>, we keep loading new neighboring <code>Chunks</code> to the PC memory and remove those chunks that are no longer considered to be in the new terrain generation zone from the PC memory. By such means we maintain a constant amount of memory usage throughout the game while keeping the player well informed of the surrounding terrain.</p>
<p><em>To be continued…</em></p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Ann Arbor is the place for me to pursue my second bachelor’s degree in the University of Michigan. It is a small but lovely town located in the south of the State of Michigan. While I was taking classes and working on the campus, I would also like to record those tiny little pieces of happiness in daily life with my lenses. These pictures help to keep my precious memories.</p>

<p>It was really wonderful for me to find that, during the summer, the town of Ann Arbor was getting more and more busy. One of the major activities in Ann Arbor in summer is the Summer Festival, in which a lot of artists and artisans would come and show off their great works. With excitement, I went to the festival, and received lots of great memories.</p>

<p>In August, FC Barcelona came to Michigan Stadium and had a match with S.S.C. Napoli. Why having a soccer match at Michigan? I would say, it was definitely because Michigan Stadium is the largest stadium in the US, the third largest stadium across the world! Although it was not an important match for the two soccer clubs, it was still really exciting. With no surprise, FC Barcelona finally won the game.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Last summer, I went to Ireland for a trip. As a fan of the Irish boy band Westlife, I was really lucky to be able to get a ticket to their concert at Croke Park in Dublin. Meanwhile, I also had a chance to explore Dublin, a city with bars and Irish folk music.</p>

<h1 id="street-performers-in-downtown-dublin"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#street-performers-in-downtown-dublin"></a> Street Performers in Downtown Dublin</h1>
<p>To my great surprise, street performing seems to be a very popular activity in Dublin. Walking in the streets in the city you could find a lot of street performers playing all kinds of musical instruments. Most of them are performing with great passion and happiness, as if they were just playing music on the street not for their living, but for fun.</p>

<p>Besides computer science, I’m also fond of photography as well as travelling around the world. I love to write travel journals to commemorate those precious moments.</p>
<p>When I was travelling, a question that I have been constantly thinking about is “what kind of pictures could represent a city’s culture?” Although a city might have different faces and it sounds impossible for me to reflect all of them in one single picture, I would try to use a series to document them. In my point of view, every single city/town on the earth has its unique culture. Only when one gets really close to the city dwellers can he/she really feels the unique culture of the place.</p>
<p>The following posts are chapters of my travelling journals. Some of them record what I’m seeing in daily life, while the others might be trying to discover the city’s culture. Hope you would enjoy my work.</p>

    <title>Hong Kong, China</title>
    <url>/2020/05/24/Hong-Kong/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Hong Kong has been one of the fastest developing metropolis in China. When I was young, my impression of Hong Kong came with the Hong Kong TV shows. Hongkongers were so good at joking and acting that their movies and TV shows have had significant influences on me, especially with the fact that I can understand Cantonese 😃. Not only me but also Chinese people in the 1980s and 1990s were greatly influenced by Hong Kong cultures.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is famous for its fast-developing metropolitan scenery, with a local nickname as “Forest of Steel/Urban Forest” (Chinese: 钢铁森林). Personally I think the nickname really describes the essence of Hong Kong — a place full of so many skyscrapers that almost covers the sky!</p>
<p>Hong Kong is also extremely crowded and busy. It is a tiny piece of land filled with millions of people. As a matter of fact, Hongkongers are experts in fully utilizing vertical spaces in every corner of the city.</p>

<p><em>Every metropolis has its dark side. Behind the crowd and business, a small alley in Hong Kong was filled with all kinds of trash. Besides the dirtiness, a big banner of “Welcome” hanging across the alley seems to have some kind of deep meaning behind the words.</em></p>

    <title>Michigan, USA</title>
    <url>/2020/05/17/Michigan/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>As a travelling enthusiast, there is no doubt that the state where I lived must somehow appear on my wishlist. During the two years in Ann Arbor, I also spent some time to explore Michigan.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>What represents Michigan? It is very easy to think of the slogan of the State of Michigan — “Pure Michigan.” However, in what way does the State of Michigan look pure? Clearly it shouldn’t be the way in which Detroit and Lansing look. Although Michigan doesn’t seem to be among the most popular states for tourism to foreigners, there are a lot of beautiful state parks as well as national parks in Michigan that make the state “pure.” I would like to categorize these places in two sections: <em>the west part of Michigan (Western Michigan)</em> and <em>the north part of Michigan (Northern Michigan)</em>.</p>
<h1 id="western-michigan"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#western-michigan"></a> Western Michigan</h1>
<p>The views in the west part of Michigan mainly comes from Lake Michigan, which is one of the five great lakes between the US-Canada border. On the west coast of the lake lies the State of Illinois and the State of Wisconsin, whereas on the east coast lies the State of Michigan. Lake Michigan is such a great lake that a large number of beaches has formed along its coast. <strong>It also produces strong wind due the combination of its location and the climate, which is the reason why Chicago is known as the “Windy City.”</strong> Generally, Lake Michigan can be viewed as a sea, and spending holidays by Lake Michigan is very much similar to the feelings of enjoying a seaside life.</p>
<p><img src="/images/lake-michigan.png" alt="Lake Michigan and the surrounding states"></p>
<p>During the past summer, I have visited several towns by Lake Michigan, including Muskegon, Pentwater, Manistee, Traverse City, and the famous Sleeping Bear Dunes.</p>
<p><img src="/images/CZQ190818DSC01882.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/images/CZQ190818DSC01912.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Both Muskegon and Manistee are typical small towns consisting of famous beaches built for holidays. A typical holiday life at these small towns would be spending a whole afternoon lying on the beach, swimming in the lake and getting tanned, and spending the night in a bar or restaurant having parties. Life there is slow and relaxing.</em></p>
<p><img src="/images/CZQ190818DSC01937.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/images/CZQ190818DSC01957.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Sleeping Bear Dunes is a famous national lakeshore at Western Michigan. There is indeed a number of great sand dunes by the lake. Although it might seem weird to most people that sand dunes should not be formed in such a wet climate, it is actually the result of special geological movements &amp; climates. The lake there is pure blue, in a sharp contrast with the yellowish sand dunes, overall producing a spectacular view.</em></p>
<p><img src="/images/CZQ190818DSC02076.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Traverse City is one of the few big cities in Western Michigan. The city has become a place for holidays. Countless tourists come here to enjoy a great view of the Great Lakes. I captured a beautiful sunset that day in the city.</em></p>

    <title>Phuket, Thailand — Sea and Sunshine! 前往普吉，感受海岸和阳光</title>
    <url>/2020/01/14/Phuket-journal/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>普吉岛，又称普吉，隶属于泰国普吉府。虽然名为“岛”， 其实它只是个半岛。这个以阳光和沙滩出名的度假胜地，一直以来都是国人东南亚游玩度假的首选。普吉岛面朝印度洋，常年温暖湿润，气候温和。虽然夏天可能有点炎热，但是冬天非常舒服，温度大约维持在25—30度之间。普吉岛地方不大，开车从最北到最南也就只有大约2—3个小时。</p>
<p>普吉岛有三大经典景观：海，沙滩，和泰国夜市。来自印度洋的碧蓝海水自然不必多说，洁白如丝绸般细腻的沙子也是大自然用海浪长年累月精雕细琢出来的杰作。然而其中最有趣的当属泰国夜市。每当夜幕降临，原本空荡荡的街道便迅速换上另一幅热闹非凡的景象。大大小小的流动摊位在路两旁卖力地招呼着熙熙攘攘的游客，酒吧里人们跟着音乐尽情跳舞。普吉岛，正是由于它白天的无敌海景和晚上的热情，成为了泰国最南端的一颗璀璨的明珠。</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>安娜堡的冬天太冷了。每一个风雪交加的日子阴沉沉，都容易让人抑郁。寒假一到，身边的同学接二连三地离开安娜堡，都在寻找一个温暖的地方度圣诞。也不知道吃了谁的安利，爸妈脑子一热，就趁我刚好寒假回了家，决定拉我出来普吉岛度假。</p>
<p><img src="/images/RZH6667post.jpg" alt="普吉岛的海滩"></p>
<p>普吉岛的天气是真的好，常年都是二三十摄氏度。这里的白天非常热，太阳非常大，傍晚的话会好一点，太阳没那么猛烈的时候温度很舒服。由于白天实在太热，岛上的人们已经养成了晚睡晚起的习惯。白天一觉睡到大中午，躲开毒辣的太阳，下午等阳光柔和了去海边散散步泡泡海水，晚上去夜市吃饭去酒吧狂欢，岂不美哉！</p>
<p>我们此次的行程包括两个部分：芭东 (Patong) 和卡伦 (Karon)。这是两个不一样的海边小镇，两个小镇都各自有一个世界级的旅游海滩：<a href="https://www.hotels.com/go/thailand/patong-beach">芭东海滩</a>和<a href="https://www.hotels.com/go/thailand/phuket-karon">卡伦海滩</a>。下文我会逐一介绍。</p>
<h1 id="芭东海滩"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#芭东海滩"></a> 芭东海滩</h1>
<p>普吉岛 (普吉府) 在行政上又被划分成了好几个区域，其中最久负盛名的就是芭东 (Patong) 和芭东海滩 (Patong Beach)。芭东是个旅游胜地。这里有全普吉岛数一数二热闹的泰国夜市，海滩上还有各式各样的水上娱乐项目：摩托艇，滑翔伞，等等。泰国夜市都在芭东城区里，也一般只有晚上的时候才最热闹。芭东城区不大，大概热闹的地方可能最远也就离海边三四条街的样子。人很多，走在街上稍显拥挤，极度不适宜开车 (说实话我是真的佩服这里的出租车司机在人海中穿行的骚操作，LOL)。</p>
<p><img src="/images/Phuket-overview.jpg" alt="芭东城区一览。多亏我们住在一个20楼的Airbnb里，才能有这么一个无敌高角度:)"><br>

    <title>¡HOLA! Puerto Rico — 波多黎各：逃离大雪的海边度假计划</title>
    <url>/2020/03/13/Puerto-Rico-journal/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>2020年注定是不平凡的一年。毕业在即，申请季结束，心思也就像一匹脱缰的野马，飞到了遥远的异国他乡 — 是的，又到春假了，是该出去走走的时候了。然而COVID-19肺炎疫情突然爆发，原本辛辛苦苦讨论好的欧洲之行也随之泡汤。本着一颗不甘心留在大雪纷飞的北方过冬的心，波多黎各计划就此成行。</p>
<p><img src="/images/PR-cover.jpg" alt=""></p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>由于是在Ann Arbor，我们从底特律出发。出发的那天特别早。大概早晨六点多，我们就打车去了机场。</p>
<p><img src="/images/PR-departure.jpg" alt="一大早我们就出发了。去机场的路上看到了非常漂亮的日出。"></p>
<p>波多黎各自由邦位于中美洲，靠近多米尼加共和国和古巴，是加勒比海上的一个小岛，岛上的官方语言是英语和西班牙语。由于地处热带，波多黎各也拥有非常迷人的海滩，椰树和阳光，气候温暖湿润。除此之外，波多黎各最久负盛名的就是得天独厚的“加勒比海蓝”。3月初的天气不冷不热，刚好是前往热带度假的好时机。</p>
<p><img src="/images/PR-bnb-beach.jpg" alt=""><br>
<img src="/images/PR-bnb-beach-2.jpg" alt="我们非常幸运地订到了一间海滩边上的民宿。傍晚时分在沙滩上走走，吹吹海风踩踩海水，看着夕阳落下，好不惬意。"></p>
<p><img src="/images/PR-bnb-sunset-building.jpg" alt="酒店附近的海边有一个墙上被涂鸦填满的破旧的小楼，配上夕阳和游泳归来的行人，甚是有中美洲风情。"></p>
<p><img src="/images/PR-bnb-cat.jpg" alt="破旧的小楼附近有一群正在玩耍的小猫咪。"></p>
<p>每天傍晚从外面玩完归来，我都喜欢在民宿楼下的海边散步。走着走着就不由得感叹，这里的海太舒服了，太惬意了。波多黎各当地人的生活节奏也很慢，大家都喜欢慢慢悠悠地享受滋润的海边生活。<br>
<img src="/images/PR-bnb-subset-father.jpg" alt="最喜欢的一张照片之一。在夕阳的余晖下，一对父子正在海边玩耍。父亲把孩子举高高，他们俩看上去都非常开心。"></p>
<p><img src="/images/PR-bnb-subset-kun.jpg" alt="同在海边拍照的Kun，和天上粉色的云。"></p>
<h1 id="viejo-san-juan-圣胡安老城"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#viejo-san-juan-圣胡安老城"></a> Viejo San Juan 圣胡安老城</h1>
<p>波多黎各最大的城市，也是它的首府，叫圣胡安 (San Juan)。圣胡安被划成了老城区和新城区，其中新城区大都聚集了很多现代的餐饮娱乐场所，比如酒吧街，购物广场等等，而老城区则保留了西班牙殖民时期鲜艳明亮的西班牙风格，有很多颜色鲜艳的小房子。除此之外，圣胡安老城区的海边还有两座古堡，应该是为了海事防御而建造的城堡。</p>
<h2 id="圣胡安古堡"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#圣胡安古堡"></a> 圣胡安古堡</h2>
<p>其实，个人觉得圣胡安的古堡没有太多的历史可以慢慢品味。然而，还是由于这个加勒比小岛上的阳光和海实在太漂亮，古堡里许多地方也就成了游客前来拍照打卡的圣地。<br>
<img src="/images/PR-castle-1.jpg" alt="城堡边上的一个小小的瞭望台。"></p>
<p><img src="/images/PR-castle-2.jpg" alt="城堡内部天台一览。"></p>
<h2 id="老城"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#老城"></a> 老城</h2>
<p>圣胡安的老城街道有非常鲜明的西班牙风格。这里的每一栋房子都被刷上鲜艳的颜色，不同颜色的房子紧挨着，形成一条条五颜六色的街道。小房子里有很多很有意思的小店和饭馆，街上人来人往。与大城市不同的是，这里的人们都非常的闲适而自由，老头老太们在店门口抽烟，年轻人三三两两在露天酒吧里喝着小酒吹着海风，街头艺人演奏着热情的中美洲音乐。走在街上，你会感到这个世界的安静与美好。</p>
<p><img src="/images/PR-sanjuan-1.jpg" alt="站在店门口的路人，吞云吐雾。"></p>
<p><img src="/images/PR-sanjuan-2.jpg" alt="从老城里望向城墙外，别有洞天。"></p>
<p><img src="/images/PR-sanjuan-9.jpg" alt="在路边表演的街头艺人。"></p>
<p>众所周知，波多黎各在2017年遭受了飓风“玛丽亚”的袭击，几乎全岛被摧毁。在老城区里，有一棵被飓风连根拔起的树倒在了草丛里。然而，事后这里的人们却依然热情地在这棵树的根部涂上了自己国旗的颜色。</p>
<p><img src="/images/PR-sanjuan-3.jpg" alt="被涂上国旗颜色的树根。"></p>
<p><img src="/images/PR-sanjuan-4.jpg" alt=""><br>
<img src="/images/PR-sanjuan-6.jpg" alt=""><br>
<img src="/images/PR-sanjuan-7.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>值得一提的是这里不仅房子都五彩斑斓，就连大停车楼也被涂上了五颜六色的图案。整个老城区都被画笔刷上了丰富的颜色。</p>
<p><img src="/images/PR-sanjuan-8.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h1 id="环岛游"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#环岛游"></a> 环岛游</h1>
<p>除了在圣胡安市区以外，我们还选了一天，绕着整个（其实准确来说是半个）岛游了一圈。我们计划从圣胡安出发，一路向西，一路向南，一直到西南角的尽头，然后天黑再返回圣胡安。</p>
<p>波多黎各朝北的海滩真的很漂亮，整个大海由远到近都充满着加勒比海的碧蓝。迎面吹来温暖舒适的海风，让人久久不能忘怀。</p>

<img src="/images/PR-roadtrip-2.jpg" alt=""><br>
<img src="/images/PR-roadtrip-2-self.jpg" alt="这个海角实在太漂亮了，我来了一张自拍：）"></p>
<p>中途还出现了一段小插曲。由于我们在朝西开的路上停留时间实在太久，比预期到达西南角的时间严重滞后，我们只好依依不舍地放弃了从西北往西南开的路上的所有景点。在半路上天公不作美，乌云密布开始下起了雨。我曾经一度认为我们可能已经提前享受完这一天美好的阳光，可能往前开也没有很大意义了。然而，车里的同行朋友们给了我坚持下去的勇气。终于，在太阳快要下山的时候，天重新开始放晴了。我们赶着最后一点阳光到达了整个岛的西南角，看到了绝美的海上夕阳。</p>
<p>在大海落下去的夕阳，实在是太美了，太美了。任何词汇都形容不出那种仿佛站在天涯海角，世界尽头的感觉。我从未感受过那么辽阔的苍穹和大海，我甚至可以肉眼看出地球表面的弧度。天黑以后，头顶上换成了满天的繁星。</p>

<p><img src="/images/PR-roadtrip-4.jpg" alt="世界尽头的落日，这可能是我能想到的最浪漫的事情。(cr: K.H.)"></p>
<p>随后，我们便按照原计划开回圣胡安。大家都太累了。那天我们都睡得特别香。</p>
<h1 id="结语"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#结语"></a> 结语</h1>
<p>五天的时间，其实挺快的。我们又重新回到了寒冷的北方。很快，我们又将各自投入到繁忙的工作和学习之中。但是，那些关于夏天的记忆，永远不会消褪。</p>

    <title>Zhuhai, China — Home, Sweet Home</title>
    <url>/2019/03/05/Zhuhai/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Of all the places I’ve been to, Zhuhai, by no doubt, is the most special one to me. I have been to almost everywhere in this city. As I grew up, countless changes have taken place in this city. People went and people came, and the city developed fast.</p>
<p>As a photographer, I have the feeling that it is my responsibility to record her changes every time I return. I really hope that my hometown can become better and better.</p>
<p><img src="/images/RZH5858post.jpg" alt="A view of Zhuhai from where I live."></p>

<p><img src="/images/RZH6144post.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Zhuhai Railway Station (Chinese: 城轨珠海站). Zhuhai Railway Station is the biggest and busiest train station connected to the high-speed CRH train in China. Dozens or even hundreds of trains leave and enter Zhuhai every day. Zhuhai Railway Station is also the endpoint of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing%E2%80%93Guangzhou_high-speed_railway">Beijing–Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong high-speed railway （Chinese: 京广深高铁线)</a>, which is a railway of over 2,000 kilometers connecting Beijing and Zhuhai. For me, Zhuhai Railway Station is a must-go if I’m going anywhere by train.</em></p>

<p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gongbei_Port_of_Entry">Gongbei Port/Gongbei Port of Entry</a> (Chinese: 拱北口岸). Gongbei Port is the biggest and the main port on the Zhuhai-Macau border. Every day, there are hundreds of thousands of people traveling to Macau thorugh this port. This picture was captured on the Chinese New Year’s Eve in 2018. On that particular day, the total passenger flow exceeded 300,000.</em></p>

<p><em>Zhuhai Bus. Zhuhai buses are frequently changing and developing. 20 years ago, all buses in Zhuhai were still the old, diesel buses. However, with the development of electric vehicles, nowadays Zhuhai buses have all switched to the new, environmental-friendly pure electric buses.</em></p>
<p><img src="/images/DSC00071-11.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>A typical old supermarket in Zhuhai. When I was young, my parents used to take me here every day after school. For six consecutive years, I bought a lot of things here: new LEGO toy bricks, new shoes, new pens and pencils, new bags, and of course, delicious snacks. This supermarket was once owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JUSCO">JUSCO (Chinese: 吉之岛)</a>, but now the ownership has been transferred to a new corporation called AEON (Chinese: 永旺).</em></p>

<p><em>Fenghuang Rd (Chinese: 凤凰路), Xiangzhou District. Due to the high population density, there will be numerous cars runing along this street every day. Typically, during the morning peak and evening peak, there will be a massive traffic congestion on this street.</em></p>

<p><em>Comebuy, one of the numerous bubble tea shops in Zhuhai. Comebuy started their business in Zhuhai several years ago and was trying to expand their business all over China.</em></p>
<p><img src="/images/DSC03425.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangzhou_District,_Zhuhai">Xiangzhou District (Chinese: 香洲区)</a>. An old small alley among the buildings. Xiangzhou District is one of the oldest area in Zhuhai, which originates from a tiny village 40 years ago. It is still the political, financial and cultural center of Zhuhai. Just like the countless other alleys, most of the food stalls here have a very long history, and any of them is able to satisfy your appetite.</em></p>
<h1 id="zhuhai-by-the-sea"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#zhuhai-by-the-sea"></a> Zhuhai, By the Sea</h1>
<p>Zhuhai, as a coastal city, has a really pretty seaside view. Although I cannot guarantee that it is as gorgeous and magnificent as those world-class famous tourism spots such as Maldives, Phuket, Miami, etc., <strong>it actually reflects the exact feeling of "living by the sea."</strong></p>
<p>The city of Zhuhai is built on several fishing villages. Before the “reform and opening-up” policy in China in 1978, Zhuhai is still a small fishing village. The dwellers at that time still made their living mainly by hunting fish. As Zhuhai develops, although more and more elements of modern cities have been added to this place (such as malls, amusement parks, etc.), what still remains unchanged is the way of living — Zhuhai citizens still love to hang out by the sea. Lovers love to start their stories by the sea. Beaches are always crowded on weekends and holidays. Fish markets are always the busiest among all markets in the city. Even the landmark of Zhuhai, as I mentioned in my <a href="https://zhihaoruan.xyz/about/">self-introduction post</a> — is about fish!</p>
<p>As a result, besides constructing more and more shopping malls in the city, the City Government of Zhuhai also focuses on improving its coastal line. So far, walking by the sea has absolutely become one of the most relaxing activities in the city life. Feel the wind breeze with the smell of the sea. Watch the boats come and go. Enjoy the sunrise and sunset on the beach. When it comes to the sea, Zhuhai turns into a romantic city.</p>

    <title>Capturing the &quot;Blue Hour&quot;</title>
    <url>/2020/05/25/blue-hour/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>“Blue Hour,” by definition, is the time period in a day when the world is covered in blue lights from the dusk or the dawn. It is usually formed in the period of twilight in the morning or in the evening when the sun is right below the horizon (more details check <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_hour">Wikipedia</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Blue hour is so famous due to its beauty</strong>. During this period, all the surroundings would be covered in the romantic blue, indicating the end of the day and the start of the night. Many famous movies, such as “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3783958/">La La Land</a>,” features the beauty of the blue hour.</p>

    <title>Getting Started with C/C++ in Visual Studio Code</title>
    <url>/2019/04/29/vscode-cpp/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In the <a href="https://shineyruan.github.io/2019/03/15/vscode-tutorials/">previous post</a> we have known that Visual Studio Code is a lightweight editor for small coding projects. However, you might still wonder how to actually take advantage of this small but powerful editor. In this post, we will see together how to write &amp; compile C/C++ codes in Visual Studio Code.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h1 id="vs-code-and-cc"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#vs-code-and-cc"></a> VS Code and C/C++</h1>
<p>C/C++ has been the most popular programming languages for decades, and almost all programming around the world know something about it. Although C/C++ programs might be a little bit trickier to compile in Windows system, VS code provides a nice solution for it.</p>
<p>This section was written with two Chinese blogs on Zhihu (知乎) as references. I really thank them for their instructions.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/30315894">Visual Studio Code 如何编写运行 C、C++ 程序？</a></li>
<li><a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/44337349">用VSCode调试C/C++代码 (通过WSL)</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="compiling-cc-in-windows"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#compiling-cc-in-windows"></a> Compiling C/C++ in Windows</h2>
<p>As for finding a compiler for C/C++ program, I personally recommend <em>Clang for Windows</em> and <em>MinGW-w64</em>. In fact, each of them is a standalone C/C++ compiler for Windows, but why do we need both? This is because it is found that <strong>there are no header files in Clang</strong>, and we have to <strong>add header files from MinGW-w64</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download <strong>Windows (64-bit)</strong> from the Pre-Built Binaries section <a href="http://releases.llvm.org/download.html">here</a>. <code>sig</code> file is not needed.</li>
<li>Download MinGW-w64 for 32 and 64-bit Windows <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/">here</a>.</li>
<li>Install Clang for Windows. Remember to select <strong>Add LLVM to the system PATH for all users</strong>. I personally recommend <code>C:\LLVM</code> as the destination folder.</li>
<li>Install MinGW-w64 anywhere (we’re going to <strong>uninstall it</strong> after moving all its files away). Remember to select <code>x86-64</code> architecture when installing.</li>
<li>Move all files from <code>mingw64</code> to <code>LLVM</code> (Image source: cite <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/30315894">here</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/images/screenshot-vscode-tutorial-5.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Uninstall MinGW-w64 by clicking <code>uninstall.exe</code>.</li>
<li>Open Command Prompt, type in <code>clang -v</code>, and you should see the corresponding version. If you see something like “not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program”, you may have to add <code>C:\LLVM\bin</code> to the system PATH manually.</li>
<li>Open VS Code, and install the following extensions from extension pack:
<ul>
<li>C/C++</li>
<li>C/C++ Clang Command Adapter (optional)</li>
<li>Code Runner (compile single source file with a right click)</li>
<li>One Dark Pro (optional, coding theme for VS Code)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create 3 JSON configuration files in a folder called <code>.vscode</code>:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><code>tasks.json</code></li>
<li><code>launch.json</code></li>
<li><code>settings.json</code> (if you want to use these settings forever, copy the content of this file into the global user settings JSON file.)</li>
</ul>
<ol start="11">
<li>Create an empty folder on your computer.</li>
<li>Open VS Code, and select “Open Folder…”. Open the empty folder you just created.</li>
<li>Create a folder called <code>.vscode</code> in VS Code.</li>
<li>Create a JSON file called <code>tasks.json</code> in the .vscode folder.</li>
<li>Copy the following content into your <code>tasks.json</code>:</li>

<p>Happy coding!</p>

    <title>Getting Started with Embedded Systems in Visual Studio Code</title>
    <url>/2019/04/29/vscode-stm32/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In the <a href="https://shineyruan.github.io/2019/03/15/vscode-tutorials/">previous post</a> we have known that Visual Studio Code is a lightweight editor for small coding projects. However, you might still wonder how to actually take advantage of this small but powerful editor. In this post, we will see together how to develop embedded system projects in Visual Studio Code.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h1 id="vs-code-and-stm32"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#vs-code-and-stm32"></a> VS Code and STM32</h1>
<p>VS Code has an open-source solution for STM32 application developments. This solution is based on an extension called <a href="https://platformio.org/">Platform IO</a>. This extension does no more than integrating the ARM-GCC toolchain as well as OpenOCD debugger with Python scripts for automatic compiling, uploading and debugging. It provides a variety of popular STM32 frameworks, such as Arduino, Standard Peripheral Library, STM32Cube, etc. It also supports almost all types of popular STM32 development boards in the market. With this extension, we can easy code, compile and upload codes to the MCU all in VS Code. In a word, it is a combination of VS Code’s excellent coding autocomplete feature and the open-source ARM-GCC toolchain.</p>
<p><img src="/images/screenshot-vscode-tutorial-2.png" alt="vscode-stm32"></p>
<h2 id="adding-a-customized-framework-to-platform-io-core"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#adding-a-customized-framework-to-platform-io-core"></a> Adding a customized framework to Platform IO core</h2>
<p>Although Platform IO has provided a large number of framework for a variety of boards, certain types of boards may lack support from some framework. Take my development experience for an example, I use STM32 value-line discovery (STM32VLDISCOVERY) board for project use, while the IDE does not offer a standard peripheral library framework support for it, which means that I cannot use standard peripheral library function calls in my project development. So how can I modify the core and add the support manually? Here comes the trick.</p>
<ol>
<li>Install the <strong>Platform IO IDE</strong> from VS Code’s extension page.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/images/screenshot-vscode-tutorial-3.png" alt="vscode-stm32-marketplace"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Install the <strong>STM32 official support</strong> from the extension home page in VS Code.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/images/screenshot-vscode-tutorial-4.png" alt="vscode-stm32-pio"></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Clone the source from <a href="https://github.com/shineyruan/STM32-PlatformIO-Support">my personal GitHub repository</a>.</li>
<li>If Platform IO IDE is installed successfully, there should be a root folder called <code>.platformio</code> in your computer. Find it out.</li>
<li>Copy everything in folder <code>stm32vldiscovery-spl</code> from the GitHub repository you just cloned into the <code>.platformio</code> folder.</li>
<li>Done!</li>
</ol>
<p>Some explanations for my modification:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <code>packages/framework-spl</code>, there are two folders:
<ul>
<li><code>platformio/ldscripts</code> contains the linker script for STM32VLDISCOVERY board;</li>
<li><code>stm32</code> contains the STM32F10x standard peripheral library from the <a href="https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stsw-stm32054.html">STMicroelectronics official website</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In <code>platforms/ststm32</code>, there are also two folders:
<ul>
<li><code>boards</code> contains a JSON file for the STM32VLDISCOVERY board. In the file, <code>spl</code> framework and <code>stm32vldiscovery.cfg</code> board config file (already in the original Platform IO core) have been added, and the required defined macro <code>STM32F10X_MD_VL</code> has been added for the board;</li>
<li><code>builders/frameworks</code> contains a Python script for the standard peripheral library framework. In the file, standard peripheral library support for STM32F10x devices has been added.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy coding!</p>

    <title>Visual Studio Code — A Simple Tutorial</title>
    <url>/2019/03/15/vscode-tutorials/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Starting from 2019, my main development environment has turned from Visual Studio to Visual Studio Code. Although part of the reason is that I have to find a way to use Linux environment in Windows for my school work, the main reason is that I’m fascinated with its small installation size and great open-source extensions support (I don’t want a dual system due to the small amount of available disk space on my PC; nor do I want a virtual machine as it is far too slow). Now, let’s take a close look at this amazing editor and feel its magic power.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-visual-studio-code"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#what-is-visual-studio-code"></a> What is <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>?</h1>
<p>Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a small streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running and version control. It mainly aims to offer a quick code-build-debug cycle for developers without any other redundant, unnecessary features. Therefore it is a perfect tool for writing small programs. However, due to a more and more extensive extension support in <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/"><em>Visual Studio Marketplace</em></a>, it also becomes more and more suitable for developing small, even middle-sized applications. Basically, you can make this tiny editor support almost all popular programming languages in the world simply by installing extensions from the Marketplace.</p>
<p><img src="/images/screenshot-vscode-tutorial-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>However, there are also a few notations:</p>
<ul>
<li>VS Code is, in essence, just an <em><strong>editor</strong></em>. Therefore, in order to compile codes in it, some external compilers must be installed onto your system.</li>
<li>VS Code is famous for its quick and convenient write-compile-run development cycle, so it is not efficient to build a complex application in it. It is created to competed with other code editors such as <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>, <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> and <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, but not big IDEs such as <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a>.</li>
</ul>

    <title>Wox — Making Your Windows 10 Better</title>
    <url>/2019/04/29/wox-tutorials/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>For Windows users, the biggest problem is that Windows system does not provide them with an efficient search engine for local file searching. Although the efficient Cortana search may cover part of the job, there is still no way for it to search for an arbitrary file in an arbitrary disk (or even Google Drive, if you had Google Drive File Stream) from the computer. In this post, I would recommend a light but efficient software for local file search called <em>Wox</em>.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h1 id="what-is-wox"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#what-is-wox"></a> What is Wox?</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.wox.one/"><em>Wox</em></a> is a free, open-source effective launcher for Windows system that enables users to find applications and files on their own computers at a very high speed. It also provides quick search over the Web, such as searching questions on Google, Bing, etc. It even provides a simple calculator in its command prompt in which you can perform simple calculations. All these nice functions can be accessed via only a shortcut key (may be <code>Alt+Space</code>), so it is very easy to use and very powerful.</p>
<p><img src="/images/screenshot-wox-tutorial.png" alt=""></p>
<h1 id="integrating-with-everything"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#integrating-with-everything"></a> Integrating with <em>Everything</em></h1>
<p>Actually, Wox does not have a search engine on its own. It has to run based on a free, powerful search engine called <a href="https://www.voidtools.com/en-us/"><em>Everything</em></a>. <em>Everything</em> is a very popular light software for local file search. As long as it indexes all the files and folder on your computer and builds its own database once, it can provide quick search over all files and folders on your computer, no matter how many disks you have.</p>
<h1 id="downloading-the-software"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#downloading-the-software"></a> Downloading the Software</h1>
<ol>
<li>Download and install <em>Everything</em> onto your computer. <a href="https://www.voidtools.com/en-us/">Source here.</a></li>
<li>Download and install <em>Wox</em> onto your computer. <a href="http://www.wox.one/">Source here.</a></li>
<li>Set your customized shortcut key to trigger search.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>

    <title>An Interactive Game — Step On the White Tiles!</title>
    <url>/2019/05/03/373Proj/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Probably one of the best interactive game projects I have seen in the class.</p>
<footer><strong>[Prof. Alanson Sample and Prof. Matt Smith</strong><cite>University of Michigan]</cite></footer></blockquote>
<br>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; <em>This project is developed together with <a href="https://regina8023.github.io">Regina (Jingliang Ren)</a>, <a href="https://voyager1998.github.io">Kun Huang</a> and Shiyu Liu.</em></strong><br>
<strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; <em>This post is written in shared effort with <a href="https://regina8023.github.io">Regina (Jingliang Ren)</a>.</em></strong><br>
<strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; <em>Special thanks to them for all their contributions!</em></strong></p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>In the passing winter semester, I took a very interesting course: <a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs373/lectures.html"><em>Introduction to Embedded System Design (EECS 373)</em></a>. I’ve learned memory-mapped I/O, interrupt, timer and many other important concepts in embedded system. The target of this course is to build an embedded system using a specific kind of development board – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actel_SmartFusion">Actel SmartFusion® SoC FPGA</a>.</p>
<p>Our final project is “Step on the White Tiles”, which is inspired by a popular mobile game <em>Don’t Tap the White Tiles (Chinese: 别踩白块)</em>. This is one of my proudest projects, so I’d like to write a blog to record this project experience and share these fun technical details with more people!</p>
<h1 id="background-interactive-gaming"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#background-interactive-gaming"></a> Background: Interactive Gaming</h1>
<p>Interactive gaming system has been developing fast for the past decades. From the Wii Remote controller created by Nintendo to the PlayStation series controller invented by Sony, it seems that people has become more and more fascinated about interactive gaming. Inspired by the existing interactive gaming system solutions, I, along with <a href="https://regina8023.github.io">Regina (Jingliang Ren)</a>, <a href="https://voyager1998.github.io">Ken (Kun Huang)</a> and Shiyu Liu planned to develop a simple interactive gaming system based on <a href="https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/soc-fpgas/1693-smartfusion">Actel SmartFusion® SoC FPGA</a>, which is a simple implementation of a popular mobile game <em>Don’t Tap the White Tiles</em> into the real world.</p>
<p><img src="/images/373_intro.png" alt="A basic user interface for the original mobile game, Don't Tap the White Tiles."></p>
<h1 id="game-rules"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#game-rules"></a> Game Rules</h1>
<p>There are 3 modes for our game: slow, medium and fast. Different modes have different numbers and speeds of tiles. At the beginning of the game, player will have 5 lives (health points).</p>
<ul>
<li>🍭 When left foot steps on a white tile, white tile becomes green and score++</li>
<li>🍭 When left foot steps on a white tile, white tile becomes red and score++</li>
<li>🌶 When player misses a white tile, he/she will lose one life (health point)</li>
<li>☠️ When all lives go, game over!</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="technical-details"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#technical-details"></a> Technical Details</h1>
<p>In the following part, I will be introducing in detail how to build this cool interactive gaming system! As mentioned before, in this project we’re using Actel SmartFusion® SoC FPGA.</p>
<h2 id="component-overview"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#component-overview"></a> Component Overview</h2>
<p><img src="/images/373_diagram.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As indicated in the graph, we use one SmartFusion® board to control 5 main peripherals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nintendo controller and LCD display for calibration Pixy camera, setting game mode, controlling start and pause</li>
<li>Projector controlled by VGA signal for projecting moving tiles, score, left health point</li>
<li>Pixy camera for detecting if player’s feet are on white tiles</li>
<li>Sound board for playing background music and sound effect</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="code-environments"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#code-environments"></a> Code Environments</h2>
<p>As for the project developing environment, we’re using <a href="https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/design-resources/1750-libero-soc">Libero SoC Design Software</a> as well as <a href="https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/design-tools/4879-softconsole#overview">Microsemi SoftConsole</a>. The specific versions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Libero SoC v11.9 SP3</li>
<li>Microsemi SoftConsole v3.4</li>
<li>Windows 10 Pro 1809 (operating system)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note that Libero SoC is neither forward nor backward compatible.</strong> A Libero SoC v11.9 project is not compatible with a Libero SoC v11.9 SP3 project.</p>
<h2 id="memory-mapped-io-advanced-peripheral-bus"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#memory-mapped-io-advanced-peripheral-bus"></a> Memory-mapped I/O &amp; Advanced Peripheral Bus</h2>
<p>In common sense, every memory address in a CPU corresponds to some place which can store data (aka “real memory”). However, in embedded systems, each input/output (I/O) device also corresponds to a specific memory address in the core. For these addresses, each of them has been mapped to an I/O device instead of “real memory”, such as Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC), General-Purpose I/O (GPIO) pins, etc. Accessing these addresses through CPU is actually accessing their corresponding I/O devices.</p>
<p>APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) is used as an interface to access these peripherals. A typical APB consists of the following signal (by naming convention):</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center">Signal Name</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center"><code>PRDATA</code></td>
<td>Data line where CPU reads from the peripheral.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center"><code>PWDATA</code></td>
<td>Data line where CPU writes to the peripheral.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center"><code>PWRITE</code></td>
<td>Indicates whether it is a <strong>read</strong> or a <strong>write</strong> transaction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center"><code>PENABLE</code></td>
<td>Indicates whether CPU has started the transaction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center"><code>PSEL</code></td>
<td>Indicates whether CPU has selected this peripheral.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center"><code>PADDR</code></td>
<td>Indicates what address CPU has chosen to interact with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center"><code>PCLK</code></td>
<td>Clock signal from CPU.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center"><code>PREADY</code></td>
<td><strong>Controlled by peripheral;</strong> indicates whether peripheral has been prepared for the transaction.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>By convention, in terms of APB, the CPU is called “master” while the peripherals are called “slaves”. While signals are generally high/low voltages which is in essence a hardware issue, APB makes generating these signals with C code possible.</p>
<p><img src="/images/373_apb.png" alt="A diagram of how we're making use of APB in our interactive game."></p>
<h3 id="implementation-in-verilog"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#implementation-in-verilog"></a> Implementation in Verilog</h3>
<p>While in most microcontrollers APB is not able to be modified because it is a very complicated circuit network soldered onto the PCB, with an FPGA we can take full advantage of that and customize our own APB. In Verilog, we can simply make use of an unused memory address and create the following module (APB interface):</p>

<p>We can see that all the I/O ports in the Verilog module has to strictly follow the APB convention mentioned above.</p>
<h2 id="vga"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#vga"></a> VGA</h2>
<p>VGA is short for <em>Video Graphics Array</em>. Although it is a relatively aged display method (introduced by IBM in 1987), its frequency (60Hz per frame) is good enough for our display purpose.</p>
<h3 id="basics"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#basics"></a> Basics</h3>
<p><img src="/images/373_vga_pin.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A VGA cable has 15 pins, 6 of them are used in the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blue, Red, Green represent color for one pixel</li>
<li>Horizontal sync and vertical sync are used to define the ends of each line and the whole frame</li>
<li>GND for ground</li>
</ul>
<p>A VGA video is a <strong>stream</strong> of frames. Each frame is made up of a series of horizontal lines, and each line is made up of a series of pixels.</p>
<p>At the beginning, there will be a scan point on top left corner of the frame. In each clock period, we should output correct RGB value for current pixel.  And the scan point will go to the next pixel. When it comes to the end of a line, the Horizontal-Sync signal will go low.</p>
<p>Then the scan point goes line by line. When it comes to the end of the frame, the Vertical-Sync will go low.</p>
<p>Till now, we refresh the whole frame for one time.</p>
<p><img src="/images/373_vga_timing.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In a word, to project a desired video, we just need to <strong>output correct RGB signal for each pixel in sequence</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="implementation"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#implementation"></a> Implementation</h3>
<p>The main logic for VGA display is implemented in C code: it determines the positions of tiles, scores and health point; then writes these information in specific APB addresses. Verilog code is only for analyzing information from these APB addresses and generating corresponding signals.</p>
<p>A 60-Hz interrupt will be generated periodically in fabric. In <code>main.c</code>,</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-c" data-language="c"><code class="language-c"><span class="token keyword">__attribute__</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>interrupt<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token keyword">void</span> <span class="token function">Fabric_IRQHandler</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">void</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>is interrupt handler, which is responsible for refresh of the whole frame.</p>
<h4 id="moving-tiles"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#moving-tiles"></a> Moving Tiles</h4>
<p>There are 8 tiles in maximum in one frame. To make them look as random as possible, I randomly generate 3 attributes for each tile:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>length</strong></li>
<li><strong>the column</strong> inside which it will move</li>
<li><strong>delay</strong> for interval between the time when a tile goes out of the frame and when it reappears at the top of the frame.</li>
</ul>
<p>In <code>vga.c</code>,</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-c" data-language="c"><code class="language-c"><span class="token keyword">void</span> <span class="token function">random_mode</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">int</span> k<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>controls the new position of kth tile based on its old position.</p>
<p>Besides, the attribute, <strong><code>left_on</code></strong>, <strong><code>right_on</code></strong>, will control color of the tile. When it is set to <code>true</code> inside <code>pixy.c</code>, the color will turn green or red.</p>
<h4 id="score-health-point"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#score-health-point"></a> Score &amp; Health Point</h4>
<p>Once <strong><code>left_on</code></strong> or <strong><code>right_on</code></strong> is set to <code>true</code> inside <code>pixy.c</code>, the variable, <strong><code>score</code></strong>, will add one.</p>
<p>If <strong><code>left_on</code></strong> and <strong><code>right_on</code></strong> are <code>false</code> until the tile goes out of the frame, one life will lose.</p>
<p>The display of score 🔢 and heart ❤️ are hard-coded in Verilog. Another way to show them is using Sprites + SRAM (see below).</p>
<h3 id="showing-more-complicated-graphs"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#showing-more-complicated-graphs"></a> Showing More Complicated Graphs</h3>
<p>Although the display for this game is fairly simple, we tried using <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics).html">Sprites</a> and SRAM, which is used for complicated graphics (but didn’t use it in final version of project).</p>
<p>The idea behind Sprites is that generate RGB values for each pixel in a picture; and then store them in SRAM of microcontroller; read RGB value for corresponding pixel from SRAM when scan point comes to the pixel.</p>
<p><img src="/images/373_sram.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The SRAM module inside SmartFusion® is shown above. Pull up <code>r_en</code> when you are reading from it, pull up <code>w_en</code> when you are writing to it.</p>
<p>However, there are two annoying issues when I implemented it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Timing. When use APB and SRAM, timing of these two things need to be considered carefully. The <code>PREADY</code> cannot be set to high all the time since SRAM need one clock period to finish reading/writing. So <code>PREADY</code> should be delayed for one clock period.</li>
<li>Memory limitation. The total size of SRAM inside SmartFusion® is only 64kB.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="nintendo-controller"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#nintendo-controller"></a> Nintendo Controller</h2>
<p>For the controller for the user menu selection, we’re using a classic Nintendo® NES controller. This is a relatively aged controller, but its signal is easy to decode and it’s sufficient for our design.</p>
<p><img src="/images/373Proj_controller_overview.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We can see that it consists of 8 buttons: Up, Down, Left, Right, Select, Start, A and B.</p>
<p>For more details, <a href="http://uzebox.org/files/NES-controller-Hydra-Ch6All-v1.0.pdf">a document that I have referred to</a> when programming the NES controller says that:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Nintendo Entertainment System or NES, also known as the Nintendo Family Computer (Famicom) was released in Japan in 1983 and shortly after in the USA in 1985. The system was even more successful than the Atari 2600 and more or less put the last stake in the heart of Atari home consoles forever. The NES sold more than 60,000,000 units worldwide in its heyday and still sells to this day (I just bought 4 of them from <a href="http://eStarland.com">eStarland.com</a>)! There are over 200 clones of the system in circulation and the word “Nintendo” is used in many cultures as a youth slang term with many “varied” meanings.</p>
<p>The system itself was nothing compared to the Propeller chip’s computing power, the NES was powered by the 8-bit 6502 running at 1.79 MHz, but the NES did have quite a bit of dedicated graphics hardware making it quite a contender in the 8-bit era, it sported multiple tile maps, graphics planes, sprites, sound, and a lot more.</p>

<h3 id="interfacing-the-nintendo-nes-controller"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#interfacing-the-nintendo-nes-controller"></a> Interfacing the Nintendo NES controller</h3>
<p>On the back of the NES controller, it is actually organized as the following figure shows.</p>
<p><img src="/images/373Proj_controller_back.jpg" alt="An inside view of an NES controller."></p>
<p>We can see that there’re five wires: brown, red, orange, yellow, white. The functions of these wires are summarized below.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center">Signal Name</th>
<th style="text-align:center">Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center"><code>GND</code></td>
<td style="text-align:center">Brown</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:center"><code>clock</code></td>
<td style="text-align:center">Red</td>

<td style="text-align:center"><code>latch</code></td>

<td style="text-align:center">Yellow</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center"><code>5V</code></td>
<td style="text-align:center">White</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The states of the 8 buttons (pressed/not pressed) will be provided at the <code>data_out</code> line, bit by bit. The <code>latch</code> and the <code>clock</code> line are used to control the clocking of the <code>data_out</code> data line. In order to get the button states from the NES controller, we need to perform the following steps.</p>

<li>Set the clock of the MCU to be greater than or equal to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mn>12</mn><mi>μ</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">s</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">12\mu\rm{s}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8388800000000001em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mord">2</span><span class="mord mathdefault">μ</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">s</span></span></span></span></span></span>.</li>
<li>Set <code>latch</code> line to LOW.</li>
<li>Set <code>clock</code> line to LOW. Now, we’re in a known state.</li>
<li>Pulse <code>latch</code> line HIGH for at least 2 cycles. This will latch the data into the shift register.</li>
<li>Read the bits in from <code>data_out</code> line. The first bit will be available after the latching process.</li>
<li>Pulse <code>clock</code> line 7 times to read the remaining bits.</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Note. The bits are inverted from the data line (LOW for pressed, HIGH for not pressed).</strong></em></p>
<p>Based on the above rules, we can create a logic in Verilog that keeps reading the button states of the NES controller in the background. To keep things simple, we use APB interface to interact with the C coding parts, and we organize the 8 button states to be in the form of an 8-bit integer in a specific APB address that can be accessed with C code.</p>
<p><img src="/images/373_controller_data.png" alt="This figure shows the 8-bit integer data format we're using for NES controller."></p>
<p>As we’re using 25MHz clock on our SmartFusion® board, we need to extend our clock signal to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mn>12</mn><mi>μ</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">s</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">12\mu\rm{s}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8388800000000001em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mord">2</span><span class="mord mathdefault">μ</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">s</span></span></span></span></span></span>.

<h2 id="lcd-display"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#lcd-display"></a> LCD Display</h2>
<p>We use <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9568">Sparkfun’s <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mn>20</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>4</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">20\times4</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.72777em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;"></span><span class="mord">2</span><span class="mord">0</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;"></span><span class="mbin">×</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord">4</span></span></span></span> serial enabled LCD display</a> in our project. The interface of this LCD is actually really simple — just UART. If you send a character <code>a</code> to it through UART, it will display an “a” on the screen; if you send a string <code>Hello World</code> to it, it will display “Hello World”.</p>
<p><img src="/images/373Proj_lcd.jpg" alt="A typical Sparkfun's 20x4 LCD display."></p>
<p>It is worth noticing that this LCD module displays characters based on the position of a cursor. This is very similar to writing on a text file. The character sent to the module will always be written at the position of the cursor. For instance, if the current cursor position is at the first position of the first line, the incoming character <code>a</code> will then be displayed at the first position in the first line. What is worth mentioning is that there are some special ASCII character pairs that have special meanings and have been hard-coded into the LCD module. For example, some of these special characters are:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center">Character Value</th>
<th style="text-align:left">Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center"><code>0xFE, 0x01</code></td>
<td style="text-align:left">Clear the entire display.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center"><code>0xFE, 0x80</code></td>
<td style="text-align:left">Set cursor position to be the first position in the 1<sup>st</sup> line. The 20 values starting from <code>0x80</code> correspond to the cursor positions from the beginning of the 1<sup>st</sup> line to the end of the first line. For the first position in the 2<sup>nd</sup> line, add 64 to <code>0x80</code>; for the first position of the 3<sup>rd</sup> line, add 20 to <code>0x80</code>; for the first position of the 4<sup>th</sup> line, add 84 to <code>0x80</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center"><code>0x12</code></td>
<td style="text-align:left">Reset the whole module.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong><em>Note. Two bytes separated by a comma means a consecutive ASCII character pair.</em> For instance, <code>0xFE, 0x80</code> means <code>0xFE</code> should be first sent to the LCD module, followed by a <code>0x80</code>.</strong></p>
<h3 id="constructing-the-user-menu"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#constructing-the-user-menu"></a> Constructing the User Menu</h3>
<p>In terms of constructing a complete user menu, we use <code>&gt;</code> as the prompt character for the selected option. We develop a data structure called <code>LCD_Display</code> to store the current contents of the 4 lines as well as the line index of the prompt character, and another <code>Menu</code> for multiple layers of the menu. For simplicity, we set each layer of the menu has a maximum size of 6.</p>

<h2 id="pixy-camera"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#pixy-camera"></a> Pixy Camera</h2>
<p><a href="https://pixycam.com/">Pixy camera</a> is a small and responsive open-source camera developed by CREATE Lab, a part of the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. It is equipped with color recognition and it can tell the location of the object in real time within its field of view. It has a very nice interface for MCU, which we can integrate into our SmartFusion® board. Particularly, it is able to transmit its color recognition results to MCU via three interfaces: I2C, SPI, and UART. It is known that SPI has the highest data transmission rate among the three popular protocols, so we decide to utilize its SPI interface.</p>
<h3 id="porting-guidelines"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#porting-guidelines"></a> Porting Guidelines</h3>
<p>According to the <a href="https://docs.pixycam.com/wiki/doku.php?id=wiki:v1:porting_guide">official documentation</a>, Pixy camera has the following available ports:</p>
<p><img src="/images/373Proj_pixy_porting.jpg" alt="The available ports and its corresponding functionality on Pixy camera."></p>
<p>with the numbering convention (looking at the back of Pixy):</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-text" data-language="text"><code class="language-text">1   2
3   4
5   6
7   8
9   10<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<h3 id="the-serial-protocol"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#the-serial-protocol"></a> The Serial Protocol</h3>
<p><em>Signature</em> is an important feature of Pixy. A signature represents a particular color: say you may want to set a signature for color red, another signature for color blue, and another signature for color yellow, etc. An <em>object</em> is the biggest object with a corresponding signature appearing in Pixy’s field of view. That is, Pixy can hold as many objects as the signatures.</p>
<p>The whole information containing in one single image is called a <em>frame</em>. A data frame can have several objects corresponding to several signatures. Pixy’s protocol enables itself to convey information for multiple objects of different colors at a time. More specifically, its serial protocol goes as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The information for each object is 14 bytes in little endian, with the first 2 bytes starting with <code>0xaa55</code>.</li>
<li>Two consecutive <code>0xaa55</code> starts a new frame, with the second <code>0xaa55</code> starts the new object.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="line-numbers language-text" data-language="text"><code class="language-text">Bytes    16-bit word    Description
----------------------------------------------------------------
0, 1     y              sync: 0xaa55=normal object, 0xaa56=color code object
2, 3     y              checksum (sum of all 16-bit words 2-6, that is, bytes 4-13)
4, 5     y              signature number
6, 7     y              x center of object
8, 9     y              y center of object
10, 11   y              width of object
12, 13   y              height of object<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>Above are the information needed for us to parse Pixy’s data. But how can we transmit data to Pixy to set the signatures? Fortunately, Pixy’s group have developed a very nice software called <a href="https://pixycam.com/downloads-pixy1/">PixyMon</a> for us to accomplish this goal. This software sets up a UART communication between PC and Pixy camera, and it can transmit data to it as soon as we click the corresponding button in the software.</p>
<p>By the means mentioned above, we’re able to get the center of the objects with specific color within Pixy’s field of view, which is a very nice method to locate the player’s feet in our project.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are also other advanced features of Pixy that we haven’t explored. For details, please visit their <a href="https://pixycam.com/">official website</a>.</p>

<p>We use <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2341">Adafruit Audio FX Mini Sound Board</a> for playing background music.</p>
<p><img src="/images/373Proj_soundboard.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>By plugging in the sound board into computer using USB cable, it will show up as a new USB key. Just copy music into it and music will be written properly in its memory.</p>
<p>To trigger audio, pull down one of trigger pins - named <code>#0</code> thru <code>#10</code>. To stop audio, pull down <code>Rst</code>.</p>
<p>The control of this board also uses the Verilog APB interface.</p>

    <title>My F1TENTH Journey — Lab 1, Introduction to ROS</title>
    <url>/2021/01/24/f1tenth-lab1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>This series of blogs marks the journey of my F1/10 Autonomous Racing Cars.</strong></em></p>
<h1 id="overview"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#overview"></a> Overview</h1>
<p>In Spring 2021 I finally got a chance to join the F1/10 Autonomous Racing Car Lab at Penn, supervised by <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~rahulm/">Prof. Rahul Mangharam</a>. To start my autonomous racing journey, I followed the <a href="https://f1tenth-coursekit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">official tutorials</a> and studied the labs &amp; projects there.</p>
<p>ROS (Robotics Operating System), is a robotics project development platform widely-used all across the world. Although it is called an “operating system”, it is actually a chain of build tools that can be used to build mixed C++/Python projects as well as provide nice &amp; convenient communication functionalities between processes. F1/10 Autonomous Racing Car dev stack is built upon ROS and C++. <strong>Lab 1 also mainly focuses on introducing ROS as well as providing some small hands-on exercises for ROS coding.</strong></p>
<h1 id="lab-materials"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#lab-materials"></a> Lab Materials</h1>
<p>The lab specs can be access <a href="https://f1tenth-coursekit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/assignments/labs/lab1.html">here</a>. A copy of PDF is also shown below.</p>

<h1 id="workspaces-and-packages"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#workspaces-and-packages"></a> Workspaces and Packages</h1>
<p>This section mainly uses the official ROS tutorials to create a Catkin workspace and a ROS package. I followed the tutorials in ROS C++, set up my workspace, and created a package.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What is a CMakeList? Is it related to a make file used for compiling C++ objects? If yes then what is the difference between the two?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A CMakeList is a script offering instructions on how to build a CMake workspace. With a proper CMakeList, we can use CMake to build the workspace by</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-bash" data-language="bash"><code class="language-bash">cmake <span class="token punctuation">..</span>
<span class="token function">make</span> <span class="token operator">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="token function">make</span> <span class="token function">install</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>As for its relationship to a Makefile, CMakeLists can be viewed as a <em>high-level wrapper</em> of Makefile. In Unix systems, a CMakeList will produce a Makefile.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Are you using CMakeList.txt for Python in ROS? Is there a executable object being created for Python?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>CMakeList for Python in ROS does not compile anything. It just imports Catkin macros and copies the corresponding Python scripts to the <code>bin</code> folder, if necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In which directory would you run <code>catkin_make</code>?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><code>catkin_make</code> should be run in Catkin workspaces, aka. <code>catkin_ws</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The following commands were used in the tutorial</strong></li>
</ul>
<pre class="line-numbers language-bash" data-language="bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token builtin class-name">source</span> /opt/ros/kinetic<span class="token punctuation">(</span>melodic<span class="token punctuation">)</span>/setup.bash
<span class="token builtin class-name">source</span> devel/setup.bash<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p><strong>Why do we need to source <code>setup.bash</code>? What does it do? Why do we have to different <code>setup.bash</code> files here and what is the difference?</strong></p>
<p><code>/opt/ros/kinetic(melodic)/setup.bash</code> provides necessary Catkin commands &amp; env variables across workspaces, such as <code>catkin_make</code>, <code>catkin_init_workspace</code>, etc. <code>devel/setup.bash</code> provides workspace-specific environment variables, such as the Python libraries it builds, the ROS packages it creates, etc.</p>
<h1 id="publishers-and-subscribers"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#publishers-and-subscribers"></a> Publishers and Subscribers</h1>
<p>In this section I wrote a simple subscriber to subscribe the LiDAR message broadcasted from F1Tenth simulator. The ROS message was a <code>sensor_msgs/LaserScan</code> it was published on channel <code>/scan</code>.</p>
<p>What’s more, I also processed the LiDAR data and found out its maximum/minimum range through a simple linear search, and published the messages on <code>/closest_point</code> and <code>/farthest_point</code> with data type <code>std_msgs::Float64</code>. I also tried to wrap up the processor in a C++ class. The entire code is shown below.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What is a nodehandle object? Can we have more than one nodehandle objects in a single node?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A <code>ros::NodeHandle</code> is an extra layer in C++ that provides RAII-style startup &amp; shutdown of the ROS node. It also offers extra functionalities for the node, such as sending/receiving ROS messages, waiting on a specific ROS message, etc. We can indeed have multiple <code>NodeHandle</code>s in a single node for creating different namespaces, but they all refer to the same ROS node.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is <code>ros::spinOnce()</code>? How is it different from <code>ros::spin()</code>?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><code>ros::spinOnce()</code> iterates the loop once more while keeping the node active, while <code>ros::spin()</code> puts the entire node into sleep and only handles data from callback functions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is <code>ros::rate()</code>?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><code>ros::Rate</code> specifies the rate of spinning loop of this ROS node.</p>

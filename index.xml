Background: The Impact of COVID-19 The outbreak of novel coronavirus COVID-19 in 2020 has brought huge attention to the administration of human society. &amp;ldquo;Social distancing&amp;rdquo; has been advocated as a very effective method to fight the virus. In order to facilitate the implementation of social distancing, we propose an idea of building a portable device that is capable of detect and predict flow statistics in real time, in order to provide insights and suggestions for traffic management.</description></item><item><title>Introduction to Semiconductor Devices</title><link>https://zhihaoruan.xyz/posts/lecturenotes/ve320-notes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jun 2020 21:27:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhihaoruan.xyz/posts/lecturenotes/ve320-notes/</guid><description>This post contains my lecture notes of taking the course VE320: Introduction to Semiconductor Devices at UM-SJTU Joint Institute.

I am a first-year robotics master&amp;rsquo;s student at the University of Pennsylvania. Prior to Penn, I received my B.S. degree in computer science engineering (CSE) at the University of Michigan, with a second B.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering (ECE) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
A picture of myself.
Relevant Classes With the advantage of being enrolled in a dual-degree program, I have taken a list of courses covering from electrical engineering to computer science, including but not limited to:</description></item><item><title>Witnessing the COVID-19 Pandemic</title><link>https://zhihaoruan.xyz/posts/gallery/covid-19/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2020 21:53:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhihaoruan.xyz/posts/gallery/covid-19/</guid><description>As COVID-19 virus spread around the world causing serious pandemic and deaths, it also has seriously impacted countless people&amp;rsquo;s lives. As a resident in the United States, my everyday life has also been affected by this pandemic in multiple aspects. After making sure that social distancing can be properly kept when I was outdoors, I decided to take my camera and witness the changes of my daily life.
Ann Arbor, MI One of the most significant changes in my life is the wide use of face masks.</description></item><item><title>Capturing the "Blue Hour"</title><link>https://zhihaoruan.xyz/posts/gallery/blue-hour/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2020 16:23:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhihaoruan.xyz/posts/gallery/blue-hour/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Blue Hour,&amp;rdquo; by definition, is the time period in a day when the world is covered in blue lights from the dusk or the dawn. It is usually formed in the period of twilight in the morning or in the evening when the sun is right below the horizon (more details check Wikipedia).
Blue hour is so famous due to its beauty. During this period, all the surroundings would be covered in the romantic blue, indicating the end of the day and the start of the night.</description></item><item><title>Hong Kong, China</title><link>https://zhihaoruan.xyz/posts/gallery/hong-kong/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2020 00:38:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhihaoruan.xyz/posts/gallery/hong-kong/</guid><description>Hong Kong has been one of the fastest developing metropolis in China. When I was young, my impression of Hong Kong came with the Hong Kong TV shows. Hongkongers were so good at joking and acting that their movies and TV shows have had significant influences on me, especially with the fact that I can understand Cantonese :-). Not only me but also Chinese people in the 1980s and 1990s were greatly influenced by Hong Kong cultures.</description></item><item><title>Michigan, USA</title><link>https://zhihaoruan.xyz/posts/gallery/michigan/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2020 16:17:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhihaoruan.xyz/posts/gallery/michigan/</guid><description>As a travelling enthusiast, there is no doubt that the state where I lived must somehow appear on my wishlist. During the two years in Ann Arbor, I also spent some time to explore Michigan.
What represents Michigan? It is very easy to think of the slogan of the State of Michigan — &amp;ldquo;Pure Michigan.&amp;rdquo; However, in what way does the State of Michigan look pure? Clearly it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the way in which Detroit and Lansing look.</description></item><item><title>Ireland</title><link>https://zhihaoruan.xyz/posts/gallery/dublin/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2020 16:36:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhihaoruan.xyz/posts/gallery/dublin/</guid><description>Last summer, I went to Ireland for a trip. As a fan of the Irish boy band Westlife, I was really lucky to be able to get a ticket to their concert at Croke Park in Dublin. Meanwhile, I also had a chance to explore Dublin, a city with bars and Irish folk music.

It is a small but lovely town located in the south of the State of Michigan. While I was taking classes and working on the campus, I would also like to record those tiny little pieces of happiness in daily life with my lenses. These pictures help to keep my precious memories.</description></item><item><title>Zhuhai, China — Home, Sweet Home</title><link>https://zhihaoruan.xyz/posts/gallery/zhuhai/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2019 00:16:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhihaoruan.xyz/posts/gallery/zhuhai/</guid><description>Of all the places I&amp;rsquo;ve been to, Zhuhai, by no doubt, is the most special one to me. I have been to almost everywhere in this city. As I grew up, countless changes have taken place in this city. People went and people came, and the city developed fast.
As a photographer, I have the feeling that it is my responsibility to record her changes every time I return. I really hope that my hometown can become better and better.</description></item><item><title>Search Results</title><link>https://zhihaoruan.xyz/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhihaoruan.xyz/search/</guid><description>This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.

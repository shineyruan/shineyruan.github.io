It attempts to build a complete system from perception to planning and control, exploring a designated unknown environments with multiple autonomous vehicles. It is built in xLab at the University of Pennsylvania, on multiple F1TENTH race cars.

Overview In Spring 2021 I finally got a chance to join the F1/10 Autonomous Racing Car Lab at Penn, supervised by Prof. Rahul Mangharam. To start my autonomous racing journey, I followed the official tutorials and studied the labs &amp;amp; projects there.
ROS (Robotics Operating System), is a robotics project development platform widely-used all across the world.</description></item></channel></rss>

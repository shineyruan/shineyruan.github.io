My F1TENTH Journey — Lab 1, Introduction to ROS Overview This lab focuses on implementing an AEB (Automatic Emergency Braking) in ROS node for F1/10 racing cars. AEB is widely used in autonomous vehicles as a basic safety guarantee to avoid collisions with objects.

Overview In Spring 2021 I finally got a chance to join the F1/10 Autonomous Racing Car Lab at Penn, supervised by Prof. Rahul Mangharam. To start my autonomous racing journey, I followed the official tutorials and studied the labs &amp;amp; projects there.
ROS (Robotics Operating System), is a robotics project development platform widely-used all across the world.</description></item><item><title>Minecraft Game Programming</title><link>https://zhihaoruan.xyz/posts/projects/560proj/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2020 14:30:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhihaoruan.xyz/posts/projects/560proj/</guid><description>In the fall of 2020, I finally had a chance to explore the field of computer graphics at University of Pennsylvania, and did a very interesting course project which builds a simplified Minecraft from scratch. This game is built on OpenGL 3.2 with Qt 5.15.0. Through building this game, I learned a lot about OpenGL rendering pipeline, game engine &amp;amp; texture mapping.
Demo Video Overview Minecraft is originally well-known for its block-like structure.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time On-Device Flow Statistics Detection and Prediction</title><link>https://zhihaoruan.xyz/posts/projects/450proj/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Aug 2020 13:40:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhihaoruan.xyz/posts/projects/450proj/</guid><description>This project was served as the Undergraduate Major Design Experience at UM-SJTU Joint Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
Background: The Impact of COVID-19 The outbreak of novel coronavirus COVID-19 in 2020 has brought huge attention to the administration of human society. &amp;ldquo;Social distancing&amp;rdquo; has been advocated as a very effective method to fight the virus. In order to facilitate the implementation of social distancing, we propose an idea of building a portable device that is capable of detect and predict flow statistics in real time, in order to provide insights and suggestions for traffic management.</description></item><item><title>SLAM — Simultaneous Localization And Mapping</title><link>https://zhihaoruan.xyz/posts/projects/467proj-slam/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2020 21:47:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhihaoruan.xyz/posts/projects/467proj-slam/</guid><description>&lt;p>Simultaneous Localization And Mapping, also known as SLAM, is a set of very important techniques in robotics, and it&amp;rsquo;s still in active research. It aims at developing different algorithms for figuring out the position of the robot in the real world by the robot itself.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>An Interactive Game — Step On the White Tiles!</title><link>https://zhihaoruan.xyz/posts/projects/373proj/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2019 17:55:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhihaoruan.xyz/posts/projects/373proj/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

It attempts to build a complete system from perception to planning and control, exploring a designated unknown environments with multiple autonomous vehicles. It is built in xLab at the University of Pennsylvania, on multiple F1TENTH race cars.

Background: The Impact of COVID-19 The outbreak of novel coronavirus COVID-19 in 2020 has brought huge attention to the administration of human society. &amp;ldquo;Social distancing&amp;rdquo; has been advocated as a very effective method to fight the virus. In order to facilitate the implementation of social distancing, we propose an idea of building a portable device that is capable of detect and predict flow statistics in real time, in order to provide insights and suggestions for traffic management.</description></item><item><title>Introduction to Semiconductor Devices</title><link>https://zhihaoruan.xyz/ve320-notes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jun 2020 23:27:13 -0400</pubDate><author>shineyruan@gmail.com (Zhihao Ruan)</author><guid>https://zhihaoruan.xyz/ve320-notes/</guid><description>This post contains my lecture notes of taking the course VE320: Introduction to Semiconductor Devices at UM-SJTU Joint Institute.
